QUOTE-GENERATOR ( HTML-CSS-JS )
1. HTML (index.html):
The HTML file defines the structure of the webpage, including a container for the quote, separate divs for the quote text and author, and a button to generate a new quote.
2. CSS (style.css):
Styles are applied to various elements, such as setting the font, centering the content, applying background color, and styling the button.
3. JavaScript (script.js):
The getQuote function is defined to fetch a random quote from the "https://api.quotable.io/random" API.
The fetched quote's content and author are then inserted into the respective HTML elements.
The getQuote function is initially called to display a random quote when the page loads.
